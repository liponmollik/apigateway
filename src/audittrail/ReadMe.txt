now I need to create a handler file to call from a remote locatoin as REST endpoint. 
How can I do that? I need to have questions, 
1. List of audit trails, 
2. Suspected users, 
3. Which users tries most with wrong password and user name, 
4. Online Leaderboard of users by maximum number of login in a time period (hourly, daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly), 
5. Which user keeps the session mostly live, 
6. Which users tries login from different devices and location, etc.
